        \item {My first project in Wix involved refactoring the design and architecture of Wixâ€™s Contacts app. My focus was mainly on front-end components and architecture.}
        \item {I was the technical lead of a team tasked with creating a unique app on a new editor platform. Starting as a weekend proof-of-concept, Wix Forms graduated from proof-of-concept to fully-fledged app in four months. My focus was on designing and implementing the underlying architecture for this new breed of apps.}
        \item {I contributed code to Wix Editor, where my largest contribution was extracting, redesigning and externalising the monolithic user authentication mechanism underlying all editor-based sites. It was one of the more challenging projects I have worked on. Consequently, it is also one of my proudest accomplishments.}
        \item {My last position was technical team lead in Wix Bookings. I've introduced a new technology (React Hooks) into the teams' legacy codebase. This also set the stage and tooling for future refactoring projects across Bookings.}
